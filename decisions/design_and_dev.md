**Dev/Design hand-off seam?**
 
* We, the dev team, should try to get views as close as we can to what they should look like, but letâ€™s not go too crazy trying to get things 100%
* We should schedule a time with Kaz to go through the css
* Have a better idea of what the end result will be
* Design app for handing things off? 
* We need a style guide
* If we have a style guide, fidelity of mockups does not need to be extremely high
