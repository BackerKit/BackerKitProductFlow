# The life of a feature

## High level flow
* Quarterly inception meeting
* Weekly Integrated Planning Meeting (IPM)
* Weekly Retrospective (Retro)

## From idea to story
* Product and Design work in Trello to create thematic feature sets
* These ideas get turned into Product Design Requirements (PRD's) in weekly
  Trello Jello meetings
* Each week on Monday we talk about the backlog of stories and point them
* Each Thursday we have a product team retro
